# Gameplay
As a player, your task is to navigate a falling star through a series of obstacles. The game becomes more challenging as the further you progress - the falling star increases in speed. Simultaneously, the background music increases in tempo, creating an intensifying atmosphere as you dive deeper into the game.

# Unique Features
One of the most noteworthy features of this game is the synchronization of game speed and background music tempo. The iOS WeChat mini-program audio API does not natively support dynamic adjustment of music playback speed. A unique solution was implemented to overcome this: multiple versions of the background music at different tempos were prepared in advance. The game seamlessly switches between these versions as the speed of the falling star increases, effectively simulating an accelerating music tempo and ensuring a smooth gaming experience across different devices.
